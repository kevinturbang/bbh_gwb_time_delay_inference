# Data directory

The data used in the analysis, as well as the obtained results can be downloaded from Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10016289). An script that
downloads the data in this subdirectory is also provided: `download_data_from_zenodo.sh`. Running this script will download
all the data and results from Zenodo. Note that these results are needed to be able to reproduce the figures of the paper, as 
explained in the `/figures` subdirectory of the repository.
