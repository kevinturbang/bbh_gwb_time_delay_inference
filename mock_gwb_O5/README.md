# Mock GWB O5 directory

This directory contains a notebook to create the mock O5 GWB measurements used to perform the analysis at a future
O5-like LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sensitivity. Note that some files need to be downloaded from Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10016289) before 
being able to run the notebook.
